Here is a map of the Philippines with markers indicating the major economic hubs for each of the three major islands in the country. The markers lead to that hub's official government website.

```{r phil_map}
df <- data.frame(lat = c(14.602,10.337,7.184), lng = c(120.987,123.938,125.455))
links <- c("<a href='http://manila.gov.ph/'>Manila, Luzon's central hub and the country's capital</a>", "<a href='https://www.cebucity.gov.ph/'>Cebu, the economic center of the Visayas group of islands</a>",
           "Davao, Mindanao's economic hub. Unfortunately, Davao's website contains malware :(")
phil <- df %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(lat = 12, lng = 122, zoom = 5) %>% addMarkers(popup = links)
